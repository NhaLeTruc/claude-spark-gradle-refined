# Specification Quality Checklist: Data Pipeline Orchestration Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

**Status**: PASS

The specification maintains appropriate abstraction levels:
- User scenarios describe workflows from data engineer perspective without mentioning Java, Scala, or specific Spark APIs
- Success criteria focus on user-facing metrics (throughput, latency) rather than internal system metrics
- Requirements describe capabilities (e.g., "support extracting data") rather than implementation approaches
- Key entities describe responsibilities and relationships without class structures or method signatures

Note: The specification necessarily mentions specific technologies (Apache Spark, Kafka, PostgreSQL, etc.) because these are explicit requirements from the user description. These are treated as external dependencies and integration points, not implementation details of the system being built.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

**Status**: PASS

All requirements are testable and unambiguous:
- FR-001 through FR-025 each specify concrete, verifiable capabilities
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-012 provide measurable outcomes with specific targets where applicable
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format for clear test cases
- Edge cases identify 10 specific scenarios requiring handling
- Scope boundaries clearly defined in "Out of Scope" section with 18 explicitly excluded items
- Dependencies section enumerates all external and internal dependencies
- Assumptions section documents 12 specific assumptions made during specification

No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all potentially ambiguous areas have been resolved through documented assumptions (A-001 through A-012).

### Feature Readiness Assessment

**Status**: PASS

Feature is ready for planning phase:
- Five prioritized user stories (three P1, two P2) with independent test criteria
- Each functional requirement traces to user scenarios and success criteria
- Success criteria provide clear targets for implementation validation
- Specification remains technology-agnostic in describing desired outcomes while acknowledging required integration technologies

## Notes

The specification successfully balances user requirements with technical constraints:
- User explicitly required specific technologies (Spark, Chain of Responsibility pattern, static methods, etc.) which are captured as constraints rather than leaked implementation details
- All ambiguous areas resolved through reasonable assumptions documented in Assumptions section
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to proceed with technical design

**Recommendation**: Proceed to planning phase. No spec updates required.
