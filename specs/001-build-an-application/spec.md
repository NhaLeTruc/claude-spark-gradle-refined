# Feature Specification: Data Pipeline Orchestration Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can help constructing pipeline of different collections of steps including but not limited to extracts, transforms, validates, and loads data from and to sources or sinks like kafka, postgres, mysql, deltalake, and amazon S3. Users must be able to create these pipelines using JSON files ONLY containing non-sensitive credential parameters. All code must be unit tested. The project must includes a docker compose environment for local integration tests. Any test data must be mocked - you do not need to pull anything from any real sources."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Create and Execute Simple ETL Pipeline (Priority: P1)

A data engineer needs to extract data from a PostgreSQL database, apply basic transformations, and load it into an S3 bucket. They create a JSON configuration file that defines the pipeline steps and execute it to process 100K records in batch mode.

**Why this priority**: This represents the core value proposition - enabling users to define and execute data pipelines through configuration alone. Without this, the application has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a JSON pipeline config with extract (PostgreSQL), transform (simple), and load (S3) steps, executing it, and verifying data successfully moves from source to sink with transformations applied. Delivers immediate value as a working ETL pipeline.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PostgreSQL source with test data and an S3 bucket configured in Vault, **When** user creates a JSON pipeline config with extract-transform-load steps and executes it, **Then** data is extracted, transformed, and loaded to S3 successfully with execution logs showing progress
2. **Given** a pipeline execution completes, **When** user reviews the logs, **Then** logs show step-by-step execution details including record counts, timing, and any warnings or errors
3. **Given** a simple pipeline processing 100K records, **When** pipeline executes, **Then** processing completes within expected throughput targets (100K records/sec for simple operations)

### User Story 2 - Create Multi-Step Complex Pipeline with Validation (Priority: P1)

A data engineer needs to build a complex pipeline that extracts from multiple sources (Kafka and MySQL), merges and validates the data, transforms it according to business rules, and loads to both DeltaLake and PostgreSQL. They configure this multi-step pipeline in a single JSON file with references to additional config files.

**Why this priority**: Demonstrates the platform's ability to handle real-world complexity with multiple sources, sinks, and data quality checks. This is essential for production use cases.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a pipeline JSON that references multiple data sources, includes validation steps, and writes to multiple sinks. Success is verified when data flows through all steps with validation rules enforced.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Kafka and MySQL sources with test data, **When** user creates a pipeline that extracts from both, validates data quality, and loads to DeltaLake and PostgreSQL, **Then** all steps execute in order with data correctly merged, validated, and written to both sinks
2. **Given** a validation step that checks data quality rules, **When** invalid data is encountered, **Then** pipeline logs validation failures and either filters invalid records or fails the pipeline based on configuration
3. **Given** a complex pipeline processing 10K records/sec, **When** pipeline executes, **Then** processing completes within expected throughput targets with all transformations and validations applied
4. **Given** a main pipeline JSON file, **When** it references external JSON files for source/sink configurations, **Then** all configurations are properly loaded and merged during pipeline instantiation

---

### User Story 3 - Execute Streaming Pipeline with Retry Logic (Priority: P2)

A data engineer needs to set up a micro-batch streaming pipeline that continuously reads from Kafka, applies transformations, and writes to DeltaLake. The pipeline must handle failures gracefully with automatic retries.

**Why this priority**: Streaming is a common requirement for real-time data processing, and reliability through retries is critical for production systems. This priority level reflects that it's important but builds on the batch foundation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting a streaming pipeline with Kafka source and DeltaLake sink, simulating failures, and verifying the pipeline retries up to 3 times with 5-second delays. Delivers continuous data processing capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Kafka topic with streaming events, **When** user creates a micro-batch streaming pipeline with Spark Streaming, **Then** pipeline continuously processes events with p95 latency under 5 seconds and throughput of 50K events/sec
2. **Given** a pipeline execution fails due to transient error, **When** retry logic activates, **Then** pipeline retries up to 3 times with 5-second delays between attempts before marking as failed
3. **Given** a streaming pipeline is running, **When** user monitors execution logs, **Then** logs show continuous processing metrics including event counts, latency measurements, and any retry attempts

---

### User Story 4 - Configure Secure Credential Management (Priority: P1)

A data engineer needs to configure database credentials, cloud IAM keys, and Kafka connection details without embedding them in JSON configuration files. They use a Vault solution to store sensitive credentials and reference them from pipeline configs.

**Why this priority**: Security is non-negotiable in production data pipelines. Without secure credential management, the application cannot be safely deployed in any real environment. This is a foundational capability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by storing credentials in Vault (populated from .env file), referencing credential paths in pipeline JSON configs, and verifying pipelines can successfully connect to sources/sinks without credentials in config files.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** credentials stored in Vault, **When** pipeline JSON references credential paths (not actual credentials), **Then** pipeline successfully retrieves credentials from Vault and connects to data sources/sinks
2. **Given** a .env file with sensitive credentials, **When** docker-compose environment starts, **Then** Vault is populated with credentials from .env and pipelines can access them
3. **Given** different credential types (JDBC, IAM, Kafka), **When** pipelines reference them, **Then** appropriate config objects (JdbcConfig, IAMConfig, OtherConfig) fetch and apply the correct credential format

---

### User Story 5 - Test Pipelines in Local Environment (Priority: P2)

A data engineer wants to develop and test pipelines locally before deploying to production. They use the docker-compose environment to spin up mock data sources and sinks and verify pipeline behavior with test data.

**Why this priority**: Local testing dramatically improves development velocity and reduces production issues. While important, it supports the development workflow rather than being core functionality for end users.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting docker-compose environment, creating pipelines against local services (PostgreSQL, Kafka, etc.), and running integration tests with mocked data. Delivers safe testing capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** docker-compose configuration, **When** developer starts the environment, **Then** all required services (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Kafka, Vault, S3-compatible storage) start successfully with health checks passing
2. **Given** local testing environment is running, **When** developer executes pipeline with test data, **Then** pipeline processes mocked data through all steps without connecting to external production systems
3. **Given** unit and integration tests exist, **When** developer runs test suite, **Then** all tests execute against local docker services with high coverage of pipeline logic

- How does the system handle credential retrieval failures from Vault during pipeline execution?
- What happens when a pipeline processes zero records from a source?
- How does the system handle pipeline execution when intermediate steps partially complete before failure?
- What happens when JSON configuration files contain circular references to other config files?
- How does retry logic behave when a pipeline fails on the third and final retry attempt?
- What happens when streaming pipeline falls behind Kafka topic lag during high-volume periods?
- How does the system handle schema evolution when source data structure changes between pipeline runs?
- What happens when multiple pipelines try to write to the same sink simultaneously?
- How does the system behave when docker-compose services fail health checks during local testing?

### Key Entities

- **Pipeline**: Represents a complete data processing workflow consisting of multiple steps. Responsible for parsing JSON configuration files and instantiating the chain of PipelineStep instances. Contains a main execution method that orchestrates step execution with retry logic.

- **PipelineStep**: Represents a single operation in the pipeline (extract, transform, validate, or load). Implements Chain of Responsibility pattern by holding reference to the next step. Each instance uses one static method from ExtractMethods, LoadMethods, or UserMethods. Handles data format conversion between Avro and Spark DataFrame as needed.

- **ExtractMethods**: Collection of static methods for extracting data from various sources (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Kafka, DeltaLake, S3). Each method returns data in standard format (Avro or Spark DataFrame). Uses credential config objects to authenticate with sources.

- **LoadMethods**: Collection of static methods for loading data to various sinks (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Kafka, DeltaLake, S3). Each method accepts data in standard format (Avro or Spark DataFrame). Uses credential config objects to authenticate with sinks.

- **UserMethods**: Collection of static methods for transforming and validating data using Apache Spark operations. Includes common transformation patterns (filtering, aggregation, joins, enrichment, reshaping) and validation patterns (schema validation, null checks, range checks, referential integrity, business rule validation).

- **JdbcConfig**: Configuration object responsible for PostgreSQL and MySQL credential management. Retrieves JDBC connection details (host, port, database, username, password) from Vault and provides them to ExtractMethods and LoadMethods.

- **IAMConfig**: Configuration object responsible for Amazon S3 credential management. Retrieves IAM credentials (access key, secret key, region, session token) from Vault and provides them to ExtractMethods and LoadMethods.

- **OtherConfig**: Configuration object responsible for Kafka and DeltaLake credential management. Retrieves connection details and authentication credentials from Vault and provides them to ExtractMethods and LoadMethods.
