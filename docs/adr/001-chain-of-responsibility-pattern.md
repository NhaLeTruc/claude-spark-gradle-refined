## Context and Problem Statement

The Data Pipeline Orchestration Application needs to execute a sequence of ETL steps (Extract, Transform, Validate, Load) in a flexible, maintainable, and extensible manner. The system must support:

1. **Sequential execution** of pipeline steps
2. **Dynamic pipeline composition** from JSON configuration
3. **Easy addition of new step types** without modifying existing code
4. **Context propagation** between steps (DataFrames, metadata)
5. **Error handling** with step-level granularity

How should we architect the step execution system to meet these requirements while maintaining clean code and SOLID principles?

---

## Decision Drivers

- **Flexibility**: Must support arbitrary step sequences
- **Maintainability**: Adding new step types should be easy
- **Testability**: Individual steps must be testable in isolation
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead from pattern implementation
- **Type Safety**: Scala's type system should catch errors at compile time
- **Composability**: Steps should be composable in any order

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Sequential List Execution

```scala
def execute(steps: List[Step], context: Context): Context = {
  steps.foldLeft(context) { (ctx, step) =>
    step.execute(ctx, spark)
  }
}
```

**Pros**:
- Simple and straightforward
- Easy to understand
- Functional programming style

**Cons**:
- No polymorphism for step types
- Difficult to add step-specific behavior
- No compile-time type safety for step sequences

### Option 2: Builder Pattern

```scala
PipelineBuilder()
  .extract(fromPostgres)
  .transform(filterRows)
  .load(toS3)
  .build()
```

**Pros**:
- Fluent API
- Compile-time type safety
- Clear step sequence

**Cons**:
- Not data-driven (can't load from JSON easily)
- Rigid structure
- Difficult to support dynamic pipelines

### Option 3: Chain of Responsibility Pattern (Selected)

```scala
sealed trait PipelineStep {
  def nextStep: Option[PipelineStep]
  def execute(context: PipelineContext, spark: SparkSession): PipelineContext

  def executeChain(context: PipelineContext, spark: SparkSession): PipelineContext = {
    val updatedContext = execute(context, spark)
    nextStep match {
      case Some(next) => next.executeChain(updatedContext, spark)
      case None => updatedContext
    }
  }
}

case class ExtractStep(..., nextStep: Option[PipelineStep]) extends PipelineStep
case class TransformStep(..., nextStep: Option[PipelineStep]) extends PipelineStep
case class ValidateStep(..., nextStep: Option[PipelineStep]) extends PipelineStep
case class LoadStep(..., nextStep: Option[PipelineStep]) extends PipelineStep
```

**Pros**:
- Each step knows its successor (loose coupling)
- Easy to add new step types (Open/Closed Principle)
- Testable in isolation
- Supports dynamic configuration
- Clear separation of concerns

**Cons**:
- Slightly more complex than simple list
- Requires careful chain construction

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: **Option 3 - Chain of Responsibility Pattern**

### Rationale

1. **Open/Closed Principle**: New step types can be added without modifying existing code. Each step type is a separate case class extending `PipelineStep`.

2. **Single Responsibility**: Each step type handles only its specific operation (extract, transform, validate, or load).

3. **Dynamic Configuration**: The pattern works perfectly with JSON-driven configuration. The `Pipeline` object constructs the chain from parsed JSON.

4. **Context Propagation**: The `PipelineContext` flows naturally through the chain, accumulating DataFrames and metadata.

5. **Error Handling**: Each step can catch and enrich exceptions with step-specific context before propagating.

6. **Testability**: Individual steps can be tested with mock contexts and no dependencies on other steps.

### Implementation

```scala
// Sealed trait ensures exhaustive pattern matching
sealed trait PipelineStep {
  def method: String
  def config: Map[String, Any]
  def nextStep: Option[PipelineStep]

  def execute(context: PipelineContext, spark: SparkSession): PipelineContext

  def executeChain(context: PipelineContext, spark: SparkSession): PipelineContext = {
    val updatedContext = execute(context, spark)
    nextStep match {
      case Some(next) => next.executeChain(updatedContext, spark)
      case None => updatedContext
    }
  }
}

// Concrete implementations
case class ExtractStep(
    method: String,
    config: Map[String, Any],
    nextStep: Option[PipelineStep]
) extends PipelineStep {
  override def execute(context: PipelineContext, spark: SparkSession): PipelineContext = {
    val df = ExtractMethods.invoke(method, config, spark)
    context.updatePrimary(Right(df))
  }
}

// Similar for TransformStep, ValidateStep, LoadStep...
```

### Chain Construction

The `Pipeline` class builds the chain by folding right over the step list:

```scala
val chainedSteps = steps.zipWithIndex.foldRight[Option[PipelineStep]](None) {
  case ((step, idx), nextOpt) =>
    Some(step match {
      case ExtractStep(m, c, _) => ExtractStep(m, c, nextOpt)
      case TransformStep(m, c, _) => TransformStep(m, c, nextOpt)
      case ValidateStep(m, c, _) => ValidateStep(m, c, nextOpt)
      case LoadStep(m, c, _) => LoadStep(m, c, nextOpt)
    })
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **Extensibility**: New step types require only:
   - A new case class extending `PipelineStep`
   - An implementation of `execute()`
   - A pattern match case in chain construction

✅ **Maintainability**: Each step type is independent and can be modified without affecting others.

✅ **Testability**: Steps can be tested in isolation with mock contexts.

✅ **Type Safety**: Scala's sealed trait ensures exhaustive pattern matching.

✅ **Composability**: Steps can be composed in any order defined by JSON configuration.

✅ **Context Propagation**: Natural flow of `PipelineContext` through the chain.

✅ **Error Handling**: Step-level error context can be added before propagation.

### Negative

⚠️ **Complexity**: Slightly more complex than a simple list iteration.

⚠️ **Chain Construction**: Requires careful right-fold to build chain correctly.

⚠️ **Immutability**: Each step returns a new context, which could have memory implications for very large pipelines (mitigated by context reuse).

### Neutral

➡️ **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the Chain of Responsibility pattern.

➡️ **Debugging**: Following execution through the chain requires understanding recursive execution.

## Alternatives Considered

### Composite Pattern

Could have used Composite pattern with `Pipeline` as composite and `Step` as leaf. However, this adds unnecessary complexity since pipelines don't nest.

### Strategy Pattern

Could have used Strategy pattern with different execution strategies. However, the sequence of steps is fundamental to ETL, not just an interchangeable strategy.

### Command Pattern

Could have encapsulated each step as a command. However, this doesn't provide the natural chaining and context propagation we need.
