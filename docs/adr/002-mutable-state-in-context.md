# ADR-002: Mutable State in PipelineContext

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Architecture Team
**Context**: Sprint 0 - Initial Architecture Design

---

## Context and Problem Statement

The `PipelineContext` carries state between pipeline steps, including DataFrames, streaming queries, cached DataFrames, and metadata. The system needs to:

1. **Accumulate state** across multiple steps
2. **Register DataFrames** by name for multi-DataFrame operations
3. **Track streaming queries** for lifecycle management
4. **Manage cached DataFrames** for performance
5. **Propagate context** through the Chain of Responsibility

Should we use immutable data structures with copy-on-write semantics, or mutable collections for performance?

---

## Decision Drivers

- **Performance**: Copying large collections on every step is expensive
- **Simplicity**: API should be easy to use and understand
- **Safety**: Minimize risk of concurrent modification issues
- **Scala Idioms**: Align with Scala best practices
- **Spark Integration**: Work naturally with Spark's DataFrame model

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Fully Immutable Context

```scala
case class PipelineContext(
  primary: Either[GenericRecord, DataFrame],
  dataFrames: Map[String, DataFrame] = Map.empty,  // Immutable
  streamingQueries: Map[String, StreamingQuery] = Map.empty  // Immutable
) {
  def register(name: String, df: DataFrame): PipelineContext = {
    copy(dataFrames = dataFrames + (name -> df))  // Creates new Map
  }
}
```

**Pros**:
- Pure functional programming
- Thread-safe by default
- No risk of unintended mutations
- Aligns with Scala best practices

**Cons**:
- Performance overhead (copying on every operation)
- Memory pressure from intermediate copies
- Doesn't align well with Spark's mutable DataFrame model
- Complex code for nested updates

### Option 2: Mutable Collections (Selected)

```scala
case class PipelineContext(
  primary: Either[GenericRecord, DataFrame],
  dataFrames: mutable.Map[String, DataFrame] = mutable.Map.empty,
  streamingQueries: mutable.Map[String, StreamingQuery] = mutable.Map.empty,
  cachedDataFrames: mutable.Set[String] = mutable.Set.empty
) {
  def register(name: String, df: DataFrame): PipelineContext = {
    dataFrames.put(name, df)  // Mutates in place
    this  // Returns same instance
  }
}
```

**Pros**:
- Better performance (no copying)
- Lower memory footprint
- Simpler code
- Aligns with Spark's mutable model
- Natural for accumulating state

**Cons**:
- Not purely functional
- Could have concurrency issues (mitigated by single-threaded execution)
- Requires care to avoid unintended side effects

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

Immutable for primary DataFrame, mutable for collections.

**Rejected**: Inconsistent and confusing API.

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: **Option 2 - Mutable Collections**

### Rationale

1. **Performance**: Pipeline steps frequently register and access DataFrames. Copying the entire context on every operation would be wasteful.

2. **Spark Alignment**: Spark DataFrames themselves are immutable references to mutable query plans. Using mutable collections aligns with this model.

3. **Single-Threaded Execution**: Pipelines execute sequentially in a single thread through the Chain of Responsibility, eliminating concurrency concerns.

4. **Practical Simplicity**: The code is clearer and easier to understand:
   ```scala
   context.register("users", usersDf)  // Clear and simple
   // vs
   val newContext = context.copy(
     dataFrames = context.dataFrames + ("users" -> usersDf)
   )  // Verbose and creates intermediate objects
   ```

5. **Accumulator Pattern**: The context acts as an accumulator, which is naturally mutable.

### Implementation Details

```scala
case class PipelineContext(
  primary: Either[GenericRecord, DataFrame],
  dataFrames: mutable.Map[String, DataFrame] = mutable.Map.empty,
  streamingQueries: mutable.Map[String, StreamingQuery] = mutable.Map.empty,
  cachedDataFrames: mutable.Set[String] = mutable.Set.empty,
  isStreamingMode: Boolean = false
) {
  // Mutating operations return `this` for chaining
  def register(name: String, df: DataFrame): PipelineContext = {
    dataFrames.put(name, df)
    this
  }

  def registerStreamingQuery(name: String, query: StreamingQuery): PipelineContext = {
    streamingQueries.put(name, query)
    this
  }

  // Safe access methods
  def get(name: String): Option[DataFrame] = dataFrames.get(name)

  def getPrimaryDataFrame: DataFrame = primary match {
    case Right(df) => df
    case Left(_) => throw new IllegalStateException("Primary is not a DataFrame")
  }
}
```

### Safety Measures

To mitigate the risks of mutable state:

1. **Encapsulation**: Mutable collections are private to the context
2. **Controlled Access**: Only specific methods can modify state
3. **Return Type**: Methods return `this` for chaining, making mutation visible
4. **Single-Threaded**: Pipeline execution is always single-threaded
5. **Immutable References**: DataFrames themselves are immutable

---

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **Performance**: No overhead from copying collections on every step

✅ **Memory Efficiency**: Single context instance throughout pipeline execution

✅ **Clarity**: Simple, understandable code without complex copy operations

✅ **Chaining**: Fluent API style:
   ```scala
   context
     .register("users", usersDf)
     .register("orders", ordersDf)
     .cache("users")
   ```

✅ **Spark Alignment**: Matches Spark's programming model

### Negative

⚠️ **Not Purely Functional**: Violates functional programming principles

⚠️ **Potential Side Effects**: Requires discipline to avoid unintended mutations

⚠️ **Testing Complexity**: Tests must be careful about state between assertions

### Mitigation Strategies

**For Testing**:
```scala
// Create fresh context for each test
override def beforeEach(): Unit = {
  context = PipelineContext(Right(spark.emptyDataFrame))
}
```

**For Production**:
- Single-threaded execution guarantees no race conditions
- Context is created once per pipeline and discarded after
- No shared global state

---

## Trade-offs

### Performance vs Purity

We chose **performance and pragmatism** over **functional purity** because:

1. ETL pipelines are inherently stateful (accumulating data)
2. Performance matters for large-scale data processing
3. The sequential execution model provides safety
4. The benefits of immutability (thread safety, time travel) don't apply here

### When This Decision Might Be Revisited

This decision should be reconsidered if:

- Parallel step execution is needed (multi-threading)
- Pipeline branching is required (multiple execution paths)
- State snapshots are needed (checkpointing, rollback)
- Functional composition becomes more important

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Lens/Optics Library

Could have used libraries like Monocle for immutable updates:
```scala
context.modify(_.dataFrames).using(_ + ("users" -> df))
```

**Rejected**: Adds complexity and dependencies without solving the core issue.

### State Monad

Could have used State monad for functional state management:
```scala
type PipelineState[A] = State[PipelineContext, A]
```

**Rejected**: Overly complex for the problem. Would make the code harder to understand for most developers.
